Welcome to the Vegetation Index Calculation Python Package! This package provides advanced features for calculating various vegetation indices from satellite imagery, allowing users to efficiently analyze vegetation patterns and dynamics. Whether you are a researcher, a data scientist, or an environmental enthusiast, this package will empower you to gain valuable insights into vegetation health and distribution.

## Features

- **Wide Range of Vegetation Indices:** The package offers a comprehensive selection of popular vegetation indices, including NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and more. Each index has been carefully implemented to ensure accurate and reliable results.

- **Support for Multiple Satellite Platforms:** The package supports a variety of satellite imagery sources, such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Planet, allowing you to easily calculate vegetation indices from data collected by different platforms.

- **Highly Customizable:** You have the flexibility to customize the parameters for vegetation index calculation, such as band combinations, coefficients, and threshold values. This ensures that the package adapts to your specific research needs.

- **Batch Processing:** The package is designed for efficiency, allowing you to process large batches of satellite images in parallel. This feature significantly speeds up the analysis and enhances productivity.

- **Visualization Tools:** Visualize the calculated vegetation indices using built-in plotting functions. These visualizations aid in understanding the spatial distribution and temporal changes of vegetation in the study area.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The package offers data preprocessing utilities, including atmospheric correction and cloud masking, to ensure the quality of input satellite imagery before index calculation.

## Installation

To install the Vegetation Index Calculation package, you can use pip:
